slug: css-fundamentals-part-2
excerpt: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It allows web developers to separate the content of a web page from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and update the design of a website. CSS can be used to control the layout, font, color, and other visual elements of a web page, providing a consistent look and feel across all pages on a website.
